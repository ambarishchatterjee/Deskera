<p>Let’s put a spotlight on the office ladies who thrive in the workplace everyday, this International Women’s Day.</p>




<h3>Seek advice from other women entrepreneurs who empower you to achieve work-life balance.</h3>




<p>The first breath of fresh air away from college. A million thoughts run through you as you pick the place of employment you choose to apply for. At this stage of your life, you are identifying what it takes to be the successful career woman.</p>

<p>At the start, you maneuver through work, learning as you go along. With more experience, you advance your career and start saving up to fulfil that eye-opening backpacking trip you desire. For a brief moment of your millennial life, you feel satisfied with your globetrotter status.</p>

<p>Over time, travel fatigue sets in and you reach a certain age of your life where you think you are ready to settle down and start a family.</p>

<p>To cope with the high costs of living, you aspire to advance your career to give your family the best of the best. Growing into a mother, you put others before you and nurture the needs of your family.</p>

<p>As the years grow by, your career brings you to a circle of high achievers who support you in your growth to develop your own business. Being of a certain level of maturity in your career, and seeking the flexibility of time in caring for your family, you take the leap and quit your job, no looking back.</p>

<p>You seek advice from other women entrepreneurs who empower you to achieve work-life balance, made easier with technological advancements. Monitor your staff’s progress with a good human resource management system (HRMS) and empower others by implementing a self-service leave application software. Implementing a customer relationship management software helps you build better client relationships as it centralizes data and track past engagement with clients.</p>

<p>This 8th March, Deskera celebrates the era of gender equality with ERP, CRM, and HRMS problem solving cloud solutions. We bring together girls and women of all ages from all walks of life around the world to celebrate female empowerment. Take a chance with the express pass to graceful adulting with proper implementation of cloud software systems.</p>
